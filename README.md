[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/about) is an Advent calendar of small 
programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be 
solved in any programming language. 

This repo is my personal attempt at solving the 
[Advent of Code 2018](http://adventofcode.com/2018) set of problems using C++.
